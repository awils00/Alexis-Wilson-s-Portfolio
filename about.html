        <p>Hello! I'm Alexis, an aspiring frontend developer. I recently graduated with an Associates of Science in Computer Information Systems from Tulsa Community College. Throughout my academic journey, I delved into various programming languages such as Python, C++, Java, and C. While these languages constituted a significant part of my degree, my exploration of technology extended beyond coding. I gained hands-on experience creating virtual machines using Oracle and developed a deeper understanding of Artificial Intelligence. </p>
        <p>However, among these experiences, none were as exhilarating as the process of crafting web pages with HTML and CSS. HTML and CSS opened up a creative outlet within the realm of computers, allowing me to express the more imaginative facets of my personality, which I hope you can see through my portfolio.
        </p>
        <p>Currently, I am continuing my education at Northeastern State University in Computer Science, working towards my bachelor's degree. During my time there, I aim to grow, learn, and connect with new people. I look forward to the exciting opportunities and challenges that lie ahead.</p>
